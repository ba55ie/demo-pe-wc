						Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to
						create reusable custom elements — with their functionality
						encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in

						<p>
							As developers, we all know that reusing code as much as possible
							is a good idea. This has traditionally not been so easy for custom
							markup structures — think of the complex HTML (and associated
							style and script) you've sometimes had to write to render custom
							UI controls, and how using them multiple times can turn your page
							into a mess if you are not careful.
						</p>
						<p>
							Web Components aims to solve such problems — it consists of three
							main technologies, which can be used together to create versatile
							custom elements with encapsulated functionality that can be reused
							wherever you like without fear of code collisions.
						</p>
						<dl>
							<dt id="custom_elements">
								<strong>Custom elements</strong>
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>
									A set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom
									elements and their behavior, which can then be used as desired
									in your user interface.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt id="shadow_dom">
								<strong>Shadow DOM</strong>
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>
									A set of JavaScript APIs for attaching an encapsulated
									"shadow" DOM tree to an element — which is rendered separately
									from the main document DOM — and controlling associated
									functionality. In this way, you can keep an element's features
									private, so they can be scripted and styled without the fear
									of collision with other parts of the document.
								</p>
							</dd>
							<dt id="html_templates">
								<strong>HTML templates</strong>
							</dt>
							<dd>
								<p>
									The <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> and
									<code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>
									elements enable you to write markup templates that are not
									displayed in the rendered page. These can then be reused
									multiple times as the basis of a custom element's structure.
								</p>
							</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>
							The basic approach for implementing a web component generally
							looks something like this:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Create a class in which you specify your web component
								functionality, using the class syntax.
							</li>
							<li>
								Register your new custom element using the
								<code>CustomElementRegistry.define()</code>
								method, passing it the element name to be defined, the class or
								function in which its functionality is specified, and
								optionally, what element it inherits from.
							</li>
							<li>
								If required, attach a shadow DOM to the custom element using
								<code>Element.attachShadow()</code>
								method. Add child elements, event listeners, etc., to the shadow
								DOM using regular DOM methods.
							</li>
							<li>
								If required, define an HTML template using
								<code>&lt;template&gt;</code>
								and
								<code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>. Again use regular DOM methods to
								clone the template and attach it to your shadow DOM.
							</li>
							<li>
								Use your custom element wherever you like on your page, just
								like you would any regular HTML element.
							</li>
						</ol>
